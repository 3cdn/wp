# ðŸš€ 3CDN Platform for Wordpress
A Wordpress plugin that makes your website use the 3CDN Platform. Note that our platform is still under development but we recommend you to try this plugin out to see what it could bring for your website.

## How it works?
It replaces all `wp-content` URLs on your pages with 3CDN URLs making the client fetch the files from our platform. If the file is not found on our servers, we'll fetch it from your server and then push it to our network.

## What file types does it work with right now?
As of now, the following types are supported: documents, videos, images and audio with more file types coming in the near future. 

## How larges can the files be?
As of now, we only support up to 25MB files. This will change very soon but this gives us time to optimize our platform and make it even better before large files get supported.

## What regions are supported?
We currently have storage nodes in Europe, United States, Asia and Africa. But don't worry, more is coming soon!
